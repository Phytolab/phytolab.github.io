Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

```julia
#Julia Code
a = 5
println(a)
```

```R
#R Code
a <- 5
print(a)
```



| Syntax      | Description |

| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |


```julia
mutable struct dog
	breed::String
	paws::Int
	name::String
	weight::Float64
           
	function dog(breed, name, weight, paws=4)
		new(breed, paws, name, weight)
	end
end

new_dog = dog("German Shepard", "Champ", 46)
dog("German Shepard", 4, "Champ", 46.0)
```
